          Nipype looks like a great framework to define small processing bricks and
          automatically assemble them to form pipelines. At <a
          href="https://inria-visages.github.io/brainhackrennes-2018/#projects">last year
          brainhack</a>, we had time to define interfaces for the <a
          href="https://github.com/Inria-Visages/Anima-Public">Anima</a> open-source
          software. The idea this time is to go all the way to define a pipeline based on
          Anima interfaces and try to run it on a cluster on some toy data.

          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28362927">ICAN</a> is a french
          multi-center study aimed at bridging clinical observations, genomic markers as
          well as quantitative imaging biomarkers to better understand the formation, the
          development and the possible rupture of intracranial aneurysms. Saccular
          aneurysms are generally localized at vessel bifurcations and several studies
          have identified the anatomical localization of saccular aneurysms as <a
          href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28667020">an important risk factor
          for rupture</a>. One of the outcomes of ICAN is a large imaging biobank
          resulting from routine medical imaging exams (ToF MRIs, CTs, or DSAs) provided
          by the 34 french participating academic hospitals.  <a
          href="https://project.inria.fr/shanoir">This data can be accessed</a> for
          further analysis through <a
          href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fict.2016.00025/full">the
          Shanoir database</a>. However the analysis of the geometrical features of the
          bifurcation that carry the IA is hampered by the lack of anatomical labelling.
          Determining to which artery belongs a bifurcation carrying a saccular aneurysms
          is a time-consuming task and requires expertise in brain anatomy.

        <h4>Objectives and expected outcomes</h4>
        <p>
          BULLE aims to design and implement an atlas-based neuroimaging processing
          workflow for automatic labelling of the cerebrovascular trunk, also known as
          the circle of Willis. These approaches, known as atlas-based segmentation, are
          based on the registration between <a
          href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0034-5">an anatomical
          atlas</a> and the patient images, and the subsequent transfer of annotations
          from the atlas to the images. We expect to gather experts in 3D MRI
          registration and vascular imaging. Based on their expertise we will
          collaboratively develop a reusable Jupyter notebook dedicated to the automatic
          annotation of cerebral vessels.

          Improve EEG-fMRI neurofeedback prediction using EEG signal only : Signal processing, graph and optimisation</a>
          <p><img src="img/image_projet_predNF.png" width="80%" alt="Neurofeedback prediction" /> </p>
        </h3> 
        <p>
          A new kind of data is available : EEG-fMRI Neurofeedback scores. 
          Neurofeedback approaches (NF) provide real-time feedback to a subject about its brain activity and help him or her perform a given 
          task. Brain activity features are extracted, online, from non-invasive modalities such as EEG or fMRI for example.
          Here, EEG and fMRI signals were acquired simultameously, and subjects recieved, in real time, NF informations extracted from EEG 
          and fMRI.
          
          The goal of this project, is to learn EEG patterns in order to predict NF scores coming from fMRI using EEG signals only, 
          as the use of fMRI is expensive and time consuming.
