		       <p>Registration is now open for Brainhack Warwick 2017. This 2-day workshop will
	            be held March 2nd - 3rd at the University of Warwick, Coventry, UK, and is part of
                    <a href="http://events.brainhack.org/global2017">BrainHack Global 2017</a>, where a constellation
                    of such events happen simultaneously around the globe. Brainhack events convenes researchers from a
                    myriad of disciplines to work together on projects related to neuroscience. Similar to hackathons in
                    the tech sector, much of the schedule is left open for attendees to work together on projects of
                    their choosing. We also include “unconference” sessions where talks are chosen by the attendees
                    based on their interests as they evolve throughout the meeting. Brainhacks are not “coding sprints”
                    or exclusive to programmers, but rather are open to brain scientists from all backgrounds.<br>
                    Working papers on the outcomes from Brainhack Warwick can appear in the Gigascience Brainhack
                    Thematic Series, and shorter project reports from the event are eligible for the annual Brainhack
                    Proceedings.<br>
                    Thanks to generous funding from the Wellcome Trust, registration is free, and includes
                    2 lunches, a conference dinner, all coffee breaks and parking. To register, please email
